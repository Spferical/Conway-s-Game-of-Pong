Conway's Game of Pong is a game designed to combine the mechanics of the
famous Pong and Conway's Game of Life.

HOW TO RUN:
If you're on Linux, run main.
If you're on Windows, run main.exe.

MENUS:
    Arrow keys - navigate
    Enter - select

HOW TO PLAY:
Movement is done with the keys displayed in the menu.
(e.g. for Player 1, the W and S keys are used
  W
  |
  S
These keys are used to move your 'paddle' up and down.

The goal of the game is to bounce the ball off of your paddle and send it past
the other player's paddle into their side of the area. I tried to make most
things configurable via the menu. Increasing the FPS can make the game much
more hectic.

Lower FPS, a smaller map size, and disabling the fancy color lerping effect can
help reduce stuttering or lag for those with not-so-powerful computers
(like me).

Have fun!
